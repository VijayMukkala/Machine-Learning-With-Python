### What does Machine Learning really means?
Machine learning is the ability of a computer system to learn from the environment and improve itself from experience without the need for any explicit programming. Machine learning focuses on enabling algorithms to learn from the data provided, gather insights and make predictions on previously unanalyzed data using the information gathered. Machine learning can be performed using multiple approaches. The three basic models of machine learning are supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning.

- In Insurance Industry , even with the integration of more modern financial economics into the insurance process, much of it relies on 'assumption based' approaches - such as determining the Discount Rate to be used - this is where __Machine Learning__ comes in.
- The data set here attempts to distinguish applicants into the categoried of levels 1-8.

- Data was obtained at a University Hospital in Portugal and contais several demographic, risk factors, laboratory and overall survival features of 165 real patients diagnosed with Hepatocellular carcinoma.
- In this exercise, we will explore the basic use of Pandas and will cover the basic commands of Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) which includes cleaning, munging, combining, reshaping, slicing, dicing, and transforming data for analysis purpose. We will also develop a classifier to predict the survival of patient having HCC
